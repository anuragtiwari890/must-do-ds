# Search an element in a sorted and rotated array

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Statement:
    # Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] of distinct elements, find the index of given key in the array. 
    # If the key is not present in the array, return -1.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Examples:
# Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3], key = 3
# Output: 8
# Explanation: 3 is present at index 8.

# Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 2], key = 6
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 6 is not present.

# Input: arr[] = [33, 42, 72, 99], key = 42
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 42 is found at index 1.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# approaches:
    # [Naive Approach] - O(n) Time and O(1) Space
        # The naive approach is to traverse the array and find the index of the given key.
        # Time complexity: O(n)
        # Space complexity: O(1)

    # [Expected Approach] - O(logn) Time and O(1) Space
        # The expected approach is to use binary search to find the index of the given key.
        # This approach applies a modified version of binary search directly to the entire rotated array. 
            # At every iteration, the middle element is checked against the key. 
            # If itâ€™s not the key, we determine whether the left half or right half is sorted by comparing values at arr[lo] and arr[mid]. 
            # If the left half is sorted and the key lies within its range, we adjust hi = mid - 1; otherwise, we shift lo = mid + 1. 
            # If the right half is sorted and the key lies within its range, we move lo = mid + 1; else, hi = mid - 1.
        # Time complexity: O(logn)
        # Space complexity: O(1)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# solution:
def search(arr, key):
  
    # Initialize two pointers, lo and hi, at the start
    # and end of the array
    lo = 0
    hi = len(arr) - 1

    while lo <= hi:
        mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2

        # If key found, return the index
        if arr[mid] == key:
            return mid

        # If Left half is sorted
        if arr[mid] >= arr[lo]:
          
            # If the key lies within this sorted half,
            # move the hi pointer to mid - 1
            if key >= arr[lo] and key < arr[mid]:
                hi = mid - 1
              
            # Otherwise, move the lo pointer to mid + 1
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
          
        # If Right half is sorted
        else:
          
            # If the key lies within this sorted half,
            # move the lo pointer to mid + 1
            if key > arr[mid] and key <= arr[hi]:
                lo = mid + 1
              
            # Otherwise, move the hi pointer to mid - 1
            else:
                hi = mid - 1

    # Key not found
    return -1
